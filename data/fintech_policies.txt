# FinGuard Payment & Transaction Policies

## Payment Decline Reasons

### Why was my payment declined?
Your payment may have been declined for several reasons:
1. Insufficient funds in your account or card
2. Card expired or not activated
3. Incorrect card details (CVV, expiry date, or billing address)
4. Bank security restrictions or fraud prevention
5. International transaction restrictions
6. Daily transaction limit exceeded
7. Technical issues with payment gateway

To resolve: Check your card details, ensure sufficient balance, contact your bank, or try a different payment method.

### Card Security and Verification
All payments require 3D Secure authentication for transactions above $100. You will receive an OTP from your bank. Transactions may be declined if OTP is not entered within 5 minutes.

## Refund Policy

### How long do refunds take?
- Wallet refunds: Instant (credited within 5 minutes)
- Original payment method: 5-7 business days
- Bank transfers: 3-5 business days
- International refunds: 7-10 business days

Refunds are processed within 24 hours of approval. However, the time taken for the amount to reflect in your account depends on your bank or payment provider.

### Refund eligibility
Refunds are available for:
- Failed transactions where money was debited
- Duplicate charges
- Service cancellations within 24 hours
- Merchant disputes (case-by-case basis)

Refunds are NOT available for:
- Transactions older than 90 days

### Partial refunds
For partial service usage, refunds are calculated on a pro-rata basis. Contact customer support with your transaction ID for partial refund requests.

## Foreign Exchange (Forex) Charges

### What are forex charges?
Forex charges apply when you make transactions in a foreign currency. These include:
1. Currency conversion fee: 3% of transaction amount
2. International transaction fee: $2 or 1% (whichever is higher)
3. Cross-border fee: 2% for transactions outside your country

Example: For a $100 USD transaction from INR account:
- Base amount: $100
- Forex markup (3%): $3
- International fee (1%): $1
- Total charged: ₹8,632 (assuming 1 USD = 83 INR)

### Zero forex cards
FinGuard Premium members get zero forex markup on first $500/month international transactions. After that, standard 2% applies instead of 3%.

### Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC)
Always choose to pay in local currency (merchant's currency) instead of your home currency. DCC rates are typically 5-8% higher than bank rates.

## Duplicate Charges

### Why was I charged twice?
Duplicate charges can occur due to:
1. Network timeout during payment (payment appears failed but actually succeeded)
2. Multiple payment attempts in quick succession
3. Technical glitch in payment gateway
4. Merchant error in processing

### Resolution for duplicate charges
- One charge will be automatically reversed within 24-48 hours
- If not auto-reversed, raise a dispute via app/website
- Provide transaction IDs for both charges
- Refund processed within 5-7 business days

### Prevention
Wait at least 30 seconds after payment attempt before retrying. Check transaction history before making another payment.
